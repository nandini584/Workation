                <p className='md:w-[40vw] md:text-base md:mb-8 mb-4 text-justify font-opensans'>We live in a world plagued with stress and disease. The average person today, leads a lifestyle that is far from conducive to the healthy functioning of their mind, body and soul; and the Chaudhry family has been no exception to that condition. Plagued by mental stress, emotional upheavals and declining physical health, they realised it was time to make sustainable lifestyle shifts for healthier living. <br /><br />
                Resorting to alternative <b>healing modalities</b> and <b>adopting mindful ways</b> of living tremendously contributed towards creating a greater sense of inner peace for them and theyâ€™ve since become advocates of sustainable living for the self and our precious Mother Earth. As they continue to tread on this path to heal themselves, Anantha Gram is their endeavour to share this knowledge with other seekers so we can together, create a more healed, loving and peaceful world whose inhabitants are able to rise in regard for their two beautiful but fleeting homes - their beloved bodies and our precious Gaia.
